# Federated-Learning
## Objective
The goal of the project was to automatically label/classify frames of videos, applying federated learning to boost the performance of convolutional neural networks (CNN).

The videos being labeled came from recordings of clinical encounters between a physician and a patient, obtained from DePaul's Wellness and Health Enhancement Engineering (WHEEL) lab. The federated learnign project
